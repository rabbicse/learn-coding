Learn basic of C. Basic implementations of C programming language.

# Build steps
- This following will create a.out
```gcc hello.c```

- The following command will create executable file as user specified
```gcc hello.c -o hello```

- The following command will create object code. This will create hello.o
```gcc -c hello.c```

- The following command will create executable from object code
```gcc hello.o -o hello```

- The *.c will match every C file in the current directory, and the -c will tell the compiler that you want to create an object file for each source file, but you donâ€™t want to link them together into a full executable program. Source: Head First C book
```gcc -c *.c```

- The following command will create executable from all object codes. The compiler is smart enough to recognize the files as object files, rather than source files, so it will skip most of the compilation steps and just link them together into an executable program called launch
```gcc *.o -o launch```
